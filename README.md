OpenSCIware (OSW) is an open source, portable and easy-to-use software for
sensor networks, cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things.

It is currently focused on Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontrollers,
but also works on AVR Atmega chips (think Arduino) and can be compiled natively
on x86 platforms.

The software includes support both for IEEE 802.15.4 compliant 2.4 GHz radio
transceivers (such as CC2420) and sub GHz transceivers (CC1101) for extended communication range.

The OSW is easy to use and to port on other hardware platforms.
